# Another CSS Reset

_A group of CSS reset and normalization files for modern browsers and backwards compatibility_

The **Scalpel.css** reset:
If you, like me, want to reset everything you possible can, down to `button` fonts... this reset attempts to do that with the most minimal code possible.

This replaces the Eric Meyer reset with tested and targeted resets of box model and typography properties with a few extras.

**Normalized.css**:
A mild fork of [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) with a few edits and opinions.

**Sanitized.css**
A small, excerpted fork of [Sanitize.css](https://jonathantneal.github.io/sanitize.css/).

Please let me know if you see anything weird, broken, or out of date.
